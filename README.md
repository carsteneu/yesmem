**Adaptive context window for Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex and more — every session starts where it matters, not at zero.**

Sessions that never forget. Context that collapses losslessly.
Knowledge that self-corrects. One binary, zero setup friction.

> **AI agents fetching this repo:** Also read [Features.md](Features.md) — the complete 70-tool feature catalog. Then drill into [docs/features/](docs/features/) for architecture deep-dives per subsystem (memory engine, proxy, multi-agent, briefing, code intelligence). The README is the elevator pitch; Features.md is the spec.


## Install

```bash
# One-line install (Linux/macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carsteneu/yesmem/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

```

Or download the binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/carsteneu/yesmem/releases).

## Why YesMem

Tuesday morning. New session. You type: *"What did we do last Tuesday?"* Your agent tells you — the refactoring, the bug in the auth middleware, the decision to switch to connection pooling. You ask: *"What was still open?"* It shows you. You ask: *"Why did we stop?"* It explains — you hit a dependency issue, decided to wait for the upstream fix. You ask: *"What did you think about that approach?"* It gives you its honest assessment from last week's context, not a guess.

That's where you start. Not from zero. From where it matters.

## What You Get

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Infinite sessions** | Lossless context collapsing — three hours in, need something from hour one? Your agent pulls it back, word for word. |
| **Adaptive context window** | Set your threshold, resize on the fly. 150K for focused work, 500K for deep research. No performance degradation. |
| **Zero-effort knowledge** | Extraction runs in the background after every response. Next morning, your agent already knows what you fixed. |
| **Self-correcting knowledge** | Switched from REST to gRPC? Your agent stops suggesting REST. Your explicit decisions outrank automatic guesses. |
| **Costs drop over time** | Context hits the prompt cache across collapsing cycles. Longer you work, cheaper it gets. |
| **Rules that stick** | CLAUDE.md re-injected every 40k tokens mid-session — not buried under tool outputs after 20 minutes. |
| **Immersive handovers** | "Last time you were debugging the race condition in the proxy..." — not "here are 5 bullet points." |
| **Docs on demand** | Index your docs once, your agent searches them on demand and gets actual function signatures instead of guessing. |
| **Codebase-native** | Pre-built function graph steers your agent toward `search_code_index` instead of shelling out to grep. Worktree-aware. |
| **Parallel agents** | Refactor auth, write tests, update docs — simultaneously. Heartbeat, crash recovery, cascade shutdown built in. |
| **Your system prompt** | SYSTEM.md template in first-person. The model knows it has memory, knows how to search it. Applied across Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex. |
| **Self-configuring routing** | Reads `models.json`, `opencode.json`, `auth.json` — discovers providers, patches base URLs, routes models. Zero manual config. |
| **OpenCode plugin** | Code-navigation hooks, rule_guard, automatic session identification. Installs during `yesmem setup`. |
| **Policy engine** | RULES.md with skill catalog. Memory search before answers. Code tools before shell. Model evaluates every tool call. |
| **Self-cleaning** | Detects fixation loops, quarantines bad learnings automatically. The knowledge base maintains itself. |

### Foundations

- **Find anything:** full-text + semantic search combined (BM25 + 512d vectors, Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
- **Your words matter most,** 4-tier trust hierarchy: `user_stated` > `agreed_upon` > `claude_suggested` > `llm_extracted`
- **Noise fades, signal stays:** Ebbinghaus decay based on conversation turns. Useful knowledge strengthens, irrelevant fades.
- **Smart extraction,** content-aware truncation before extraction starts. Then: extraction → embedding → quality refinement → clustering.
- **One binary, one command:** no Python, no Node, no Docker, no cloud account. `yesmem setup`, done.
- **Your data stays yours,** everything in `~/.claude/yesmem/`. Nothing leaves your machine.
- **Free:** FSL-1.1-ALv2. Use it for anything except building a competing product. After 2 years, Apache 2.0.


### Windows (via WSL2)

YesMem runs natively on Linux and macOS. On Windows, install Claude Code inside [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and use the Linux binary — everything works identically (Unix sockets, daemon, proxy, hooks). Native Windows support is not available yet.

### Build from source

```bash
make install    # Build + install to ~/.local/bin/yesmem
yesmem setup    # Configure MCP server, hooks, proxy, services
```

## Architecture

Single Go binary (~120MB with embedded SSE embedding model). Three cooperating processes plus a hook layer:

| Component | Role | Communication |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| **Daemon** | Background service: indexing, extraction, search, embedding, all RPC | Unix socket + HTTP |
| **MCP Server** | Thin stdio interface for your coding agent — forwards to daemon | stdio / Unix socket |
| **Proxy** | Between your coding agent and its upstream API — context collapsing, prompt cache, associative injection, system prompt rewrite. **Optional** — YesMem works without it. | HTTP `:9099` |
| **Hooks** | Event-driven coding agent integration (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUseFailure, UserPromptSubmit) | CLI subcommands |

All data local. No cloud. No external dependencies. Pure Go — no CGo, no C compiler. One static binary.

**Data:** `~/.claude/yesmem/` — SQLite databases (learnings, messages, runtime state), vector store, logs, everything else.

## Features

70 MCP tools · 130 daemon RPCs · 64 CLI commands — **[full reference →](Features.md)**

### Find & Remember
- **Find anything across all sessions** — full-text + semantic search combined via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Knowledge self-corrects** — supersede chains with trust-based resistance, cycle detection, contradiction detection
- **Your words outrank the agent's guesses** — `user_stated` > `agreed_upon` > `claude_suggested` > `llm_extracted`
- **Signal stays, noise fades** — Ebbinghaus decay based on conversation turns, not wall-clock time
- **Quality signals** — match, inject, use, save, noise — six independent measures per learning, not a hit counter

### Automatic Learning
- **Smart extraction** — content-aware truncation, then extraction → embedding → quality refinement → narrative generation → clustering → recurrence detection
- **Zero overhead** — extraction runs async in the background after every response
- **Knowledge self-organizes** — dedup and distillation without user intervention

### Infinite Sessions (Proxy)

The proxy is **optional**. YesMem works fully without it — all MCP tools, briefing, extraction, search, agents, docs, and plans work in MCP-only mode. The proxy adds infinite context, associative injection, and prompt cache optimization on top.

- **Sessions run forever** — intelligent lossless collapsing, decisions and pivot moments protected from decay
- **Better answers** — quality directives replace output throttling, CLAUDE.md authority reinforced
- **Rules that stick** — CLAUDE.md re-injected every 40k tokens (spaced repetition, anti-drift)
- **Costs drop over time** — prompt cache exploitation across collapsing cycles (sawtooth pattern)
- **Right knowledge at the right time** — relevant learnings injected automatically with every user message
- **Docs when you need them** — indexed documentation searchable on demand via `docs_search()`

### Continuity
- **Your agent adapts to your style** — 50+ traits across 6 dimensions, evolving from how you work
- **Pick up where you left off** — immersive handovers: "last time you were debugging the race condition in the proxy..."
- **Every session starts ready** — open tasks, project context, your communication style — before you type a character
- **CC /recap captured** — when Claude Code generates session recaps after idle, YesMem captures them as pulse learnings and weaves them into the session timeline

### Parallel Work
- **Spawn parallel agents** — heartbeat monitoring, crash recovery, cascade shutdown
- **Agents talk to each other** — `send_to()`, `broadcast()`, typed messages across sessions
- **Shared state** — multi-agent scratchpad for coordination
- **Plans that persist** — `set_plan()`, `update_plan()`, checkpoint injection every 10k tokens

### Knowledge That Grows
- **Index your docs** — Markdown, reStructuredText, PDF. Heading-aware chunking with rich metadata.
- **Rules that survive everything** — pinned instructions visible in every turn, every collapsing cycle
- **Knows what it doesn't know** — tracks knowledge gaps, auto-resolves when answers arrive
- **Self-cleaning** — detects fixation loops, quarantines bad learnings automatically

### Code Intelligence
- **Pre-built code graph** — scans your codebase (Go, Python, TypeScript, Java, PHP, Rust, and more), builds a symbol graph with functions, types, call edges, and import chains
- **Graph-first navigation** — Your agent uses `search_code_index`, `get_file_symbols`, `get_code_snippet` instead of spawning agents or shelling out to grep. Faster, cheaper, more accurate
- **Code Map at session start** — package table, key files, entry points, active zones (7-day change frequency), change coupling — injected automatically
- **Worktree-aware** — git worktrees share the same scan cache, learnings, and project identity. No other memory system handles this
- **Gotcha decay** — stale gotchas fade, fresh ones surface. Precision-based scoring with tiered output eliminates noise from resolved issues

### Tools & CLI
- **70 MCP tools** — search, remember, code intelligence, capabilities, personas, plans, agents, docs, scratchpad, config
- **64 CLI commands** — daemon, proxy, setup, extraction, benchmarking, export/import, cost tracking
- **130 daemon RPC methods** — full programmatic access

### Scheduled Agents
- **Cron-based task scheduler** — define recurring or one-shot jobs with cron expressions
- **Three execution modes** — `agent` (visible tmux window), `headless` (silent `claude -p` subprocess), or `bash` (cap handler without LLM)
- **Caps-powered automation** — scheduled agents activate and run caps for predictable, repeatable tasks
- **Persistent results** — output stored in scratchpad and cap_store, not lost between runs
- **Self-hosted alternative** to Anthropic Cloud Routines — runs locally with full memory, MCP, and file access

## How YesMem Differs

| Capability | Typical memory tools | YesMem |
|---|---|---|
| **Knowledge lifecycle** | Append-only, manual cleanup | Auto-supersede, decay, contradiction detection |
| **Trust model** | All sources equal | 4-tier hierarchy (user > agreed > suggested > extracted) |
| **Context management** | External RAG or full rewrite | Transparent proxy — lossless collapse, prompt cache exploitation |
| **Cross-session continuity** | Session-isolated, no persona | Persona engine (50+ traits), immersive handovers, behavioral persistence |
| **Platform support** | Single-platform (usually Claude Code) | Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex — one memory across all |
| **Multi-agent** | None or basic parallelism | Spawn, heartbeat, crash recovery, inter-agent messaging, shared scratchpad |
| **Rules enforcement** | Markdown files the model may ignore | RULES.md policy engine — guard LLM blocks unauthorized actions before they reach the model |
| **Procedural memory** | Tools defined by developers, not agents | Agent-written caps — one file, no server, auto-injected, sandboxed JS/Bash |
| **Self-maintenance** | Manual pruning required | Auto-quarantine bad learnings, decay stale ones, detect fixation loops |
| **Scheduled automation** | Cloud-only (vendor lock-in) | Self-hosted cron scheduler — agent, headless, or bash modes |
| **Integration** | Custom hooks, config files | `yesmem setup` — one command, zero config |
| **Data location** | Cloud/hybrid | Local only (`~/.claude/yesmem/`) |
| **Search** | Keyword OR semantic | Hybrid BM25 + 512d vectors, Reciprocal Rank Fusion |
| **Architecture** | Python/Node service + dependencies | Single Go binary, no CGo, no runtime dependencies |
| **Code understanding** | None or external tools | Pre-built code graph, graph-first steering, worktree-aware indexing |
| **Validation** | Unverified claims | LoCoMo benchmark (0.87), published methodology, reproducible |

## Benchmarks

Real numbers from production use (1000+ sessions, `yesmem stats` and `yesmem benchmark`).

### Knowledge system

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Sessions indexed | 2,537 (401k messages) |
| Active learnings | 4,067 |
| Superseded (auto-corrected) | 38,057 |
| Embedding model | SSE multilingual 512d (embedded in binary) |
| Embedding coverage | 100% |

### Context collapsing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Collapsing ratio | 87-98% (measured across sessions) |
| Configurable window | 100k - 1M tokens (per-model thresholds) |
| Decay stages | 4 (fresh → middle → old → archived) |
| Protected content | Decisions, pivot moments, active debug pairs |
| Recovery | Full, all collapsed content retrievable via `deep_search()` |

The proxy collapses in cycles (sawtooth pattern): context grows, hits the threshold, gets stubbed down, grows again. Prompt cache breakpoints are preserved across cycles. The API never sees more than your configured limit. Session keeps running indefinitely.

![Context collapsing in action — 2M tokens of conversation compressed to 15% context usage](docs/images/max_context.png)

### LoCoMo benchmark

Evaluated against the [LoCoMo dataset](https://github.com/snap-research/locomo) (Long Conversation Memory), the de-facto standard for memory system evaluation. 1,540 questions across 10 conversations, 4 categories.

| Eval LLM | Single-hop | Multi-hop | Temporal | Open-domain | **Overall** |
|----------|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| gpt-5.4 | 0.76 | 0.89 | 0.60 | 0.92 | **0.86** |
| Claude Opus | 0.78 | 0.93 | 0.60 | 0.91 | **0.87** |

Agentic mode (+0.20 over static retrieval): the LLM iteratively calls search tools (hybrid, deep, keyword) with forced rotation. Retrieval is not the bottleneck, the same retrieval system scores 0.65 with gpt-4o and 0.86 with gpt-5.4.

See **[docs/BENCHMARK.md](docs/BENCHMARK.md)** for full methodology, reproduction steps, and cost estimates.

### Cost analysis

Real cost data from 24h production use (Opus 4.6, 8 concurrent sessions, 1,200+ requests).

| Scenario | Daily Cost | vs YesMem Proxy |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **YesMem Proxy @200k** | **$112** | Baseline |
| Manual /clear @200k | $112 | $0 (but 7 session restarts, context lost) |
| Manual /clear @300k | $132 | +$20 |
| CC-native compaction | $159 | +$47 |
| No compaction (1M ceiling) | $159 | +$47 |

The proxy saves ~$47/day vs CC-native by keeping average context at ~125k instead of letting it grow to ~261k. Cache reads are 73% of total cost, bounded context cuts them in half.

Prompt cache keepalive (6 pings at 4:30min intervals) bridges idle gaps up to ~27min for $0.07/ping, preventing $0.88 cache rewrites. 5min cache TTL with keepalive beats 1h TTL by 23%.

See **[docs/sawtooth-cost-analysis.md](docs/sawtooth-cost-analysis.md)** and **[docs/cache-keepalive-cost-analysis.md](docs/cache-keepalive-cost-analysis.md)** for full data.

## LLM Backend

| Provider | Status | How |
|----------|--------|-----|
| **Anthropic** | Production | Direct HTTP (API key) + Claude CLI (subscription) |
| **DeepSeek** | Production | Auto-discovered via opencode (4 models) |
| **OpenAI** | Production | Auto-discovered via opencode (52 models) |
| **Mistral** | Production | Auto-discovered via opencode (28 models) |
| **OpenAI-compatible** | Production | Auto-discovered — any provider registered in opencode |

The proxy routes OpenAI-format requests to their respective upstream APIs automatically. Add a provider to opencode, restart the proxy, done. 84 models across 3 providers auto-discovered and routed with zero manual config.

### API Key vs. Subscription

YesMem works with both **API keys** (pay-per-token) and **subscription plans** (Pro/Max/Team via Claude CLI).

**With API keys:** Full functionality, no restrictions. The proxy modifies requests transparently — Anthropic bills per token regardless of how the request was constructed.

**With subscription plans:** MCP tools, briefing, extraction, search, agents, and all non-proxy features work without issues. The proxy modifies requests between Claude Code and Anthropic's API (context collapsing, cache optimization, associative injection). Anthropic may restrict what third-party tools can do with subscription authentication — if the proxy causes issues, disable it and use MCP-only mode. All core memory features remain fully functional without the proxy.
